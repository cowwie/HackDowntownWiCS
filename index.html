                <p>Not to worry! You’ll meet plenty of people when you get here, at our team-building event. Many people go to hackathons without teams, so it’s perfectly normal to go around to people, tell them you’re looking for a team, and ask if you can help out. You can also join a team on our <a href="https://discord.gg/WjV7d9vz">Discord</a> and sign up together on our <a href="https://hackdowntown2025.devpost.com/?preview_token=KcENpz12ivJKdFI5f61lzjit1bWBPJhqeTIqk%2F%2BqS9g%3D">Devpost</a>.</p>
